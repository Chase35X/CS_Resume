                        <li>
                            Python

                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Python was the first programming language I experimented with. During the summer of 2021 (going into my junior year of high school), I decided to self teach myself Python through YouTube videos and at home projects. Many of these projects incorporated the Discord and BeautifulSoup APIs for Discord bots and webscraping.

                        <li>
                            Java

                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Once I fell in love with Python, I decided to incorporate CS based courses in my high school schedule. At my high school, Java was the main programming language taught through the 2 years of courses I took.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            JavaScript

                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    In addition to Java based classes, my high school offered a class that focused on JavaScript. Rather than learning JS directly, we used Code.org to implement their app lab to make interactive web interfaces (many examples seen to the right!). Though this was not a generic way of learning JavaScript I still grasped the basics of the language.

                            </ul>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            HTML, CSS, and JS (Frontend Development)

                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    During the summer of 2023 (summer before my freshman year of college), I decided to expand my programming skills to frontend development. To learn HTML, CSS, and JS, I used a Coursera course linked <a href = "https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers" title = "Coursera Course Taken" target="_blank">here</a>. Thanks to this course, I was able to make this resume you are reading right now!

                                <li>Tic-Tac-Toe was the very first CS project I made in high school. My teacher was astonished with the skills and commitment I incorporated into this project considering the instructions were basic. Though intuitive, there are flaws and bugs in the app due to this being my first ever project, but, to me, this is a major milestone in my programming development.</li>

                                <li>Wordle was my final project that I submitted for this specific CS course (the one that incorporated Code.Org). I went above and beyond, using word APIs, new algorithms, and making a database and login system.</li>

                                <li>The official name for the Code.Org centered class was AP Computer Science Principles. AP stands for Advanced Placement and indicates that there is an AP exam and project linked to the class through CollegeBoard. For CSP, I needed to build an app based on serveral requirements. On this specific exam, I scored a 5, which is the highest one can score.</li>
