                                    Python was the first programming language I experimented with. During the summer of 2021 (going into my junior year of high school), I decided to self teach myself Python through YouTube videos and at home projects. Many of these projects incorporated the Discord and BeautifulSoup APIs for Discord bots and webscraping.
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    Once I fell in love with Python, I decided to incorporate CS based courses in my high school schedule. At my high school, Java was the main programming language taught through the 2 years of courses I took.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    In addition to Java based classes, my high school offered a class that focused on JavaScript. Rather than learning JS directly, we used Code.org to implement their app lab to make interactive web interfaces (many examples seen to the right!). Though this was not a generic way of learning JavaScript I still grasped the basics of the language.
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    During the summer of 2023 (summer before my freshman year of college), I decided to expand my programming skills to frontend development. To learn HTML, CSS, and JS, I used a Coursera course linked <a href = "https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers" title = "Coursera Course Taken" target="_blank">here</a>. Thanks to this course, I was able to make this resume you are reading right now!

                                <li>Tic-Tac-Toe was the very first CS project I made in high school. My teacher was astonished with the skills and commitment I incorporated into this project considering the instructions were basic. Though intuitive, there are flaws and bugs in the app due to this being my first ever project, but, to me, this is a major milestone in my programming development.</li>

This program runs off of a command system and photos can be added to the database of photos through a command itself. This was a fun personal project which can be used in any discord server.</li>

                                <li>Retail Recap was a consulting service I ran for around 3 years in high school. It consisted of alerting subscribers of profitable items you can buy and flip. Alongside this, there was also products that would "drop" or release at a set time which were profitable as well. This Python file, which uses the Discord API, was used to spread information, via embeds, quickly to these subscribers. The program uses webhooks mainly as a way to mainstream information.</li>

                                <li>Sometimes when operating Retail Recap, quick notifications or alerts would need to be sent out to subscribers. Most of the time the program above (Retail Recap Flip &amp; Drop Notification System) would take too long to send quick alerts. This program incorporated Discord API commands in order to send quick embedded messages to subscribers.</li>

                        Retail Recap was the first ever business I built from the ground up. RR (for short) was a subscription based consulting service which provided subscribers with information on items that they could flip for profit or "drop" information for products in which they could buy and sell for a profit. Under Retail Recap, I also started other smaller companies. To name a few, there were Retail Tracker, Stellar Setups, and Retail Setups. All companies were written in Python and used the Discord API.

                        StellarAIO is a retail based automated checkout software which became popular during the COVID-19 pandemic. In short, StellarAIO was selling software. Though I did not work as a software engineer for StellarAIO, I handled many things on the business end, and, with this, I learned lots of technical skills on the way. From customer service to strategy I learned what you truly need to make a product succeed.
